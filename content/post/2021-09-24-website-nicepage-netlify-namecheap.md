I've just set up a single page website (= online business card) for myself and my husband: https://pius.cloud/ .
This post summarises what I did.
If you're looking to get started with something super quickly, then only steps A and B1 are essential.

## Creating a website

I've created websites using various tools such as straight up HTML, Wordpress, Hugo+blogdown (this site - riinu.me), bootstrap, etc.
Each has their strengths and weaknesses and I'm always keen on trying out new things.
After a couple of quick Google searches I decided to make my next website using Nicepage.
I'm using the macOS app, but it also has a Windows version and it can be used online without installing anything on your computer.

Looks like Nicepage is a relatively new website builder, founded in 2018, and at the time of writing, it only has 248 Twitter followers: https://twitter.com/NicepageApp.
I'm not very active on Twitter, and I have 923.
Yes, it's a bit bizarre to quote these numbers in a blog post, but it will be cool to read this in a few years when I have 1k, and they're at 100k.
They certainly deserve it, as my experience with creating a website using Nicepage has been awesome! It's so damn good!

What I did was:

* Create a new blank website
    + __I never do this!__ I don't believe in re-inventing the wheel, and I'm not a designer.
    I just wanted a really simple 'business-card-like' look that I couldn't find in any of the templates.

* Delete all pages except Home:

![click on Pages, then delete those not wanted](/img/nicepage_website/manage_pages.png)

* Remove the menu, since I only have a single page.
From what I can tell, the only way to remove the menu is to remove the header:

![click on the dots next to the logo, hide header](/img/nicepage_website/hide_header.png)

* Add a New Block split by two
* Add in image and text elements.
    + I experimented with the built-in Block Designs a bit, but ended up using a Blank again.
    Thing is, I was trying to use the Team designs for us.
    But I could not figure out how to use distinct social media icons for different 'team members'.
    Whenever I deleted Twitter from my husband, it also removed it from me.
    I failed to unlink the two profiles.
    Thus, I created a blank box and added the image and text elements.
* Play around with various settings for alignment. Use the Phone option to resize the text on small screens only (works so well!), use Preview, etc.

* Export to HTML.
