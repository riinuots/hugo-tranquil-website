I've been doing data science for over 10 years now. Although most of this time I didn't realise I was doing data science. I thought I was just doing normal science but focusing on simulations and data analysis, rather than field or lab work. I've switched fields a few times now- physics BSc, Chemistry PhD, now working in medical research. Therefore, instead of this lenghty introduction:

>  "I'm a physicist by background with substantial interdisciplinary expertise in simulations, data analysis, programming..."

I just go with:


> I'm a data scientist.

Anyway, here's how my toolbox and technical skills have evolved over the years:

P.S. Once a physicist, always a physicist.
