I've been doing data science for over 10 years now. Of course, most of this time I didn't quite realise I was doing data science. I thought I was just doing normal science but focusing on simulations and data analysis, rather than field or lab work. Because I've now switched fields a few times - physics BSc, Chemistry PhD, now working in medical reseach. So saying "I'm a data scientist" is a lot easier than "physicist with lots of experience in simulations and data analysis and programming" (although: once a physicist, always a physicist).

Anyway, here's how my toolbox and technical skills have evolved over the years:
