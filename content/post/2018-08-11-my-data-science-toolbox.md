I've been doing data science for over 10 years now. Of course, most of this time I didn't realise I was doing data science. I thought I was just doing normal science but focusing on simulations and data analysis, rather than field or lab work. I've switched fields a few times now- physics BSc, Chemistry PhD, now working in medical research. Therefore, saying "I'm a data scientist" is easier than "physicist with substantial interdisciplinary expertise in simulations/data analysis/programming" (although: once a physicist, always a physicist).

Anyway, here's how my toolbox and technical skills have evolved over the years:
