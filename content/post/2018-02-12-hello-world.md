# We are live!

I wrote my last blog post on Wordpress on 20-October 2017. I've been blogging on Wordpress since 2014 and the more I used the more painful it got! This is most likely caused by the fact that I have been thrifting further and further away from point-and-click interfaces...oh and discovering MARKDOWN.
