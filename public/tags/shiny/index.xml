      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing data science for over 10 years now. Of course, most of this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I was doing data science. I thought I was just doing normal science but focusing on simulations and data analysis, rather than field or lab work. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched fields a few times now- physics BSc, Chemistry PhD, now working in medical research. Therefore, saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist&amp;rdquo; is easier than &amp;ldquo;physicist with substantial interdisciplinary expertise in simulations/data analysis/programming&amp;rdquo; (although: once a physicist, always a physicist).</description>

      <description>What is Shiny? Shiny is an R package (install.packages(&amp;quot;shiny&amp;quot;)) for making your outputs interactive. Furthermore, Shiny creates web apps meaning your work can be shared online with people who don&amp;rsquo;t use R. In other words: with Shiny, R people can make websites without ever learning Javascript etc.
I am completely obsessed with Shiny and these days I end up presenting most of my work in a Shiny app.
If it&amp;rsquo;s not worth putting in a Shiny app it&amp;rsquo;s not worth doing.</description>
