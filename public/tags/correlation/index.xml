      <description>This is a short note based on this.
Answer in short: Because different formulas are used to calculate the R-squared of a linear regression, depending on whether it has an intercept or not.
R2 for a linear model that has an intercept:
,
where y is the variable that the linear model is trying to predict (the response variable), y^ is the predicted value and y- is the mean value of the response variable.</description>
