      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing data science for over 10 years now. Of course, most of this time I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise I was doing data science. I thought I was just doing normal science but focusing on simulations and data analysis, rather than field or lab work. I&amp;rsquo;ve switched fields a few times now- physics BSc, Chemistry PhD, now working in medical research. Therefore, saying &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist&amp;rdquo; is easier than &amp;ldquo;physicist with substantial interdisciplinary expertise in simulations/data analysis/programming&amp;rdquo; (although: once a physicist, always a physicist).</description>

 Step 2 Get all your wordpress posts into one XML: WP Admin - Tools - Export.
 Step 3 Install Exitwp and its dependencies (pyyamp, beautifulsoup4, html2text):
git clone https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp.git sudo easy_install pip sudo pip install pyyaml sudo pip install beautifulsoup4 sudo pip install html2text This worked on macOS1 High Sierra - I already had python installed.</description>

      <description>We are live! I wrote my last blog post on Wordpress on 20-October 2017 and promised myself this was the last time. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blogging on Wordpress since 2014 and the more I used it the more painful it got! This is most likely caused by the fact that I have been thrifting further and further away from point-and-click interfaces anyway&amp;hellip;oh and discovering MARKDOWN.
My two rules:  text is written in Markdown (I use R Markdown/knitr/bookdown, e.</description>
